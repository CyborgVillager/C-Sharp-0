 v0 C# Respo Created: Learning C#, has some interest in further learning about it due to some past year projects that
                        I've worked on using VR/unity for a MMO/world building type of game basic progression from
                        cave/stone era to medevil -> steam punk/industrial era -> modern -> scifi. So
                        far made it to cave/stone era

                        Figured the more I know about C# I can further improve this concept. Granted for now it will just
                        be controls, will implement VR later.(Made some VR implements, but figured its better to get
                        the essentials sorted out before I add VR, due to certain factors at the moment).
